The Semester GPA Calculator is a mobile application developed using Flutter to help students efficiently calculate their Grade Point Average (GPA) for a semester. The app allows users to dynamically add or remove subjects, enter numerical grades and corresponding credit hours, and automatically computes the weighted GPA based on the input data.

The application features a modern, responsive UI built with Material 3 design principles, using cards for each subject, a floating action button for adding subjects, and a summary card displaying the calculated GPA and total credits. The GPA calculation logic converts numerical grades into grade points using a predefined scale and applies a weighted average formula to ensure accurate academic results.

The project demonstrates advanced state management using StatefulWidgets, dynamic list handling, and input validation, ensuring stability and a smooth user experience. The app also provides a foundation for future enhancements, including multi-semester tracking, cumulative GPA calculation, local data persistence, and report export functionality.

Overall, the Semester GPA Calculator serves as a practical tool for students and a showcase of professional Flutter development skills, combining UI design, dynamic data handling, and computational logic into a single, user-friendly application.
